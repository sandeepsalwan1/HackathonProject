This email appears to be low risk, with a probability of 10%. The indicators used to determine this include:
1. The subject and content of the email seem legitimate. It is a standard notification about a scheduled meeting to discuss a project, which is common in work communication.
2. The language and tone of the email are professional and do not contain urgent requests or threats commonly found in phishing emails.
3. The email does not include any suspicious links or attachments that could potentially lead to phishing websites.

However, it is still essential to exercise caution when receiving such emails, especially if there are any unusual requests or if the sender's identity cannot be verified.
